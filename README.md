# Welcome to ksh!

## What is ksh?
ksh aims to be a simple shell for newer users. Ksh offers shorter command syntax, and easier command arguments. Ksh is a shell that I am writing for some learning expeirence. I am
very excited to share my shell, and hopefully have users enjoy it just as much as I do!

## Project Status
This project is very early in development. I cannot give any information on when this project will be done. Even when I do get a stable release, I will probably end up majorly 
rewriting a majority of my code as I learn more, and get better at programming.
